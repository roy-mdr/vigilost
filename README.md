School project for finding lost objects

## Setup and build

Honestly I don't remember... But is a C++ QT project so that's a hint!

## Download

https://github.com/roy-mdr/vigilost/releases

## Usage

1. A student leaves an object somewhere in the school
1. The school personal finds the lost object
1. The school personal register the object in ***VigiLost Server***
1. The student can open ***VigiLost*** (client) and search for any keyword registered and finds it!
1. The student goes to the lost and found department and asks for it
1. The school personal registers who took that object so it can still be found on the "Found" database
1. Everyone happy

## Known issues

- It only works on Windows and in the same machine (using local text file as database)
